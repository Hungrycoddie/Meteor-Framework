Meteor is an open-source framework for developing web, mobile and desktop applications using JavaScript. It makes it easy to build full-stack applications with Node.js and MongoDB in the back-end and any of the most used front-end frameworks like React, Svelte, Vue and Blaze.

- Built-in authentication that is super easy to use and very secure. We won't cover auth on this section.
- Hot Module Replacement to improve developer experience applying updates to the client without reloading the page while it is running. 
- Meteor embraces the JavaScript ecosystem supporting any NPM package and also having packages written specifically for Meteor on Atmosphere.
- You can easily integrate your app with React Native or Cordova for building mobile apps.
- Meteor provides a package for methods that enforces and facilitates input validation.
- Meteor provides testing utilities to allow you to ensure your application works the way you think it does. You can create any type of tests as Unit tests, Integration tests, Acceptance tests and Continuous integration tests.
- TypeScript support to make your code more readable and less prone to runtime errors. We won't cover TS on this section.
- Meteor integrates naturally with GraphQL and has an Apollo package allowing you to use DDP and EJSON with Apollo. We won't cover GraphQL on this section.
- You can deploy Meteor apps anywhere just like any regular Node.js application. You could use the Meteor Up tool to run it on a server, Docker for a container-based deployment, or our recommended way using Galaxy. Galaxy is part of the Meteor Cloud platform. Where you can build, monitor, host and scale your application confidently with zero DevOps.
